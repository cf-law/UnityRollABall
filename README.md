# UnityRollABall
A very simple Roll a Ball game made in Unity

Based on the Unity 'Learn' Tutorial. Modifications made to increase stage size and include a 'lose condition'

A compiled version can be found under Builds and will run on most machines.

Potential future improvements:
  - Camera that better follows the ball properly when the ball turns.
  - 'Animate' the lose condition, maybe the ball explodes?
  - Better conditions such that if the user wins, they cannot induce the lose condition by rolling the ball off the edge
